# ProxParent
ProxParent is a lightweight basic python proxy

#Notice
This project is very(!) simple and on the beginning of it's creation.

# Basic Usage
The basic usage of the proxy is very simple.<br>
All you need to do is just start `main.py` (by the way, the proxy works on port 8080).<br>
---GUI---<br>
The GUI is Tkinter based with simple implementation of `PIL`.

# Statistics
<b>pygal required!</b><br>
After closing the proxy browsing statistics are saved as json into `jsondata.json`.<br>
To view the statistics just run `statistics.py` and follow the instructions.<br>
All of the statistics will view in the browser with SVG graphics.

# Parent customization
The parent can choose which website or word to block using the `control.py` file.

Let's make project rise and create a real good python based proxy using this amazing community.
